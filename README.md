## Domain - Finance
## Project 2 : [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/kumarnav03/Fraud_Detection)

### Goal 
We aim to explore the options when we have highly skewed dataset to prepare the model and best performance meteric to be used for evaluation and prepare a model comparison report.

### Work Plan:
 1. Here will see how to deal with imbalanced dataset
 2. What performance metric we should choose and Why?
 3. How to deal with highly skewed dataset - Undersampling , Oversampling , SMOTE
 4. Perform Precision-Recall trade off
