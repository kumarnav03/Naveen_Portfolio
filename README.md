### Conclusion
  1. We have identifed the way to clusters our customers with optimal cluster being 7 where error did not decrease significantly
  2. Based on Mean cost spend by the customer promotion or membership can be decided
  3. Based on Mean frequency of customer promotion date and time can be decided as most of the sales happen during day time 12 PM - 3 PM
  4. Top 15 sold products will help in inventory management
  5. Customer retention heatmap will help in schedule the promotion event date
