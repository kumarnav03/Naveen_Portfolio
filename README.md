## Domain - Retail
## Project 1 : [Customer Purchase Behaviour Study](https://github.com/kumarnav03/Customer_Segmentation)

Problem : We need to understand our customer's purchase behaviour and rank them on the basis of how much they spend, how frequent they visit and how recent they visited.

### Research shown:
  1. Cohort Analysis
  2. Customer Retention
  3. Recency Frequency Monetary Model (RFM)
  4. EDA
  5. Elbow method for Optimum clusters

## Domain - Finance
## Project 2 : [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/kumarnav03/Fraud_Detection)

### Goal 
We aim to explore the options when we have highly skewed dataset to prepare the model and best performance meteric to be used for evaluation and prepare a model comparison report.

### Work Plan:
 1. Here will see how to deal with imbalanced dataset
 2. What performance metric we should choose and Why?
 3. How to deal with highly skewed dataset - Undersampling , Oversampling , SMOTE
 4. Perform Precision-Recall trade off
 
## Domain - Entertainment

### Overview
Providing Statistical understanding for movie rating dataset.
### Research shown:
  1. EDA
  2. Feature Selection - Chi-square test

## Domain - Customer Service
## Project 4 : [Customer Complaint Analysis](https://github.com/kumarnav03/Data-Science-Python-/blob/master/NYC311_project.ipynb)

### Overview
We aim to understand the customer complaints and its resolution time & Feature responsible for reolution time.

### Research shown:
  1. EDA
  2. Hypothesis Testing & Chi-square testing
